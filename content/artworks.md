# Sketch
Wandering around procreate and paper/pencil üìÉ. Started since August 2023 for procreate and life-time for papers.

`Sep 2` I think lighting in sketch is much harder than in 3D.

## Inktober 2023 (but Blender)

It's ink! but in blender.  This is the first time I use grease pencil üòÑ. Here are the top three pieces I like so far.

# Fun comic

A fun (out-of-the-box) comic about my daily life here.

# 3D Model

**Blender** is so fun, why I just knew that. Started since June 2023, like super baby level üë∂

<div class="row">

    <video width="100%" controls autoplay>
        <source src="/images/artworks/beach_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    This video took my laptop 20 hrs to finish and it's 3 seconds!

`2008` After I watched "Wall-E" with my dad, I told him I wanna be an animator. He let me go to animation summer school! Here are what I created from **3ds Max** and **Maya**. As I can recall, I modeled doraemon from scratch in 3ds Max and rigged in Maya. TBH, I can't remember the process how I did it. I was super young. But some sense is still here.

No one would believe me if I say I have 1x yrs animation experience in the resume üòÇ. I'd never do that. Anyway, 3D animation has always been fun for me!

`Nov 23, 2023` After I watched "Wish", I'd confess that deep down I still wanna be an animator (If I could do it). But this would be heavily on the technology side right now. 

# Crochet

Started since Jan 2021. Imma like a grandma friend? üòÑ I usually do crochet when I wait for my code or sometimes when I can't debug them.

# Poem

When it comes, it comes. Life is easier than you think. Why make it so complicated? At the end of the day, it is nothing. 

`2023` ü´§ How do you know that?

# Reflection on My Hidden Messages

Someone once said that I always put some hidden message in my art. I usually don't know that (honestly), but the ones who see it keep telling me that. Here is my turn to explain what I was thinking. Hope we are on the same page!

`Sep 7, 2023` <a href="/projects/tangled/"> Tangled's scene from CS148's final project </a>

`Nov 22, 2023` I think the decision that scared me the most turns out to be the best decision I could ever make -- like in <a href="/projects/crazy_painting/"> these paintings </a>. Why is it like that?
