# Sketch
Wandering around procreate and paper/pencil üìÉ. Started since August 2023 for procreate and life-time for papers.

`Sep 2` I think lighting in sketch is much harder than in 3D.

## Inktober 2023 (but Blender)

It's ink! but in blender.  This is the first time I use grease pencil üòÑ. Here are the top three pieces I like so far.

# Fun comic

A fun (out-of-the-box) comic about my daily life here.

# Infographic

This was inspired by the visualization after TEDx talks. I think every complicated topic can be easily understood with the help of some images.

# 3D Model

**Blender** is so fun, why I just knew that. Started since June 2023, like super baby level üë∂

`2008` After I watched Wall-E with my dad, I told him I wanna be an animator. He let me go to animation summer school! Here are what I created from **3ds Max** and **Maya**. As I can recall, I modeled doraemon from scratch in 3ds Max and rigged in Maya. TBH, I can't remember the process how I did it. I was super young. But some sense is still here.

<!-- No one would believe me if I say I have 1x yrs animation experience in my resume üòÇ. I'd never do that. Anyway, 3D animation has always been fun for me! -->

`Nov 23, 2023` After I watched Wish, I admit that deep down I do really wanna be an animator. This is who I am my entire life. 

<!-- Before that, I thought this dream might be impossible, and even now I still think it is really far to reach. But hey! stop lying to yourself, I MUST try. (If I could do it) This would be heavily on the technology side right now.  -->

# Crochet

Started since Jan 2021. Imma like a grandma friend? üòÑ I usually do crochet when I wait for my code or sometimes when I can't debug them.

# Papercraft

My new hobby (again!?) since Dec 2023. 

![papercraft-stanfordbunny](/images/artworks/papercraft.jpg)
It's like we do a 3D low-poly model. But how do I remove these folding guides? I'll figure it out later.  

`Dec 23, 2023` I figured out two ways; (1) paint it the white color (2) copy the templete to blank papers and remember all of 100 connecting edges. Of course, it's me. I chose to try (2) üòÑ!

# Sculpting

Started life-time for sculpting. 

My dad got his new clay spinner recently. He left the old one, so I stole it üòÑ. I bought a pack of air dry clay to play with! 

## Clay

`Jan 23, 2024` One special thing about our sculpture is my dad crafted the wooden sculpture tools, so that the tools are prefectly handful for our hands!

## Digital sculpting
Bought an ipad app, Nomad Sculpt, as my imaginary reward in Jan 2024. Everything I sculpted is now a mess üòÜ, still during an incline learning curve.

# Painting

Picking up some brushes üñåÔ∏è like Van Gogh! (or like yourself?) Started life-time for painting.

## Watercolor
I almost forget how much I love to do watercolor since when I was a kid üòä. Glad I have time to do this. Understand how water flow is always mesmerizing, I should paint more often.

# Poem

When it comes, it comes. Life is easier than you think. Why make it so complicated? At the end of the day, it is nothing. 

`2023` ü´§ How do you know that? How could you know that?

# Reflection on My Hidden Messages

Someone once said that I always put some hidden message in my art. I usually don't know that (honestly), but the ones who see it keep telling me that. Here is my turn to explain what I was thinking. Hope we are on the same page!

`Sep 7, 2023` <a href="/projects/tangled/"> Tangled's scene from CS148's final project </a>

`Nov 22, 2023` I think the decision that scared me the most turns out to be the best decision I could ever make -- like in <a href="/projects/crazy_painting/"> these paintings </a>. Why is it like that?
