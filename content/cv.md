## About me

<img align="left" src="/images/profile.png" alt= "Jinpu" width="130" height="145" style="margin: 15px">

My name is Romrawin Chumpu. You can call me "Jin" in short. My professional goal is to become a good researcher in the fields of computer simulation and machine learning. Based on my experience, my current topics of interest include (but not limited to)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⚙️ **Computer simulation** - fluid and materials simulation (macro or micro-nano scale) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧊 **Computer graphics** - UV texture/mapping, mesh processing, and 3D visualization <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🤖 **Machine learning** - geometric deep learning, LLM, physics-informed neural networks, diffusion, generative adversarial networks, and graph neural networks <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🖼️ **Computer vision and image processing** - 2D and 3D facial study, object recognition, image and dense captioning. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🗣️ **Natural language processing** - LLM, image and dense captioning <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⚗️ **Computational chemistry/biology** - epidemiology model, organic chemistry, materials property prediction, and _materials discovery_

> I'm most excited about materials discovery. If anyone want to discuss about this, please don't hesitate to email me!

Also, I am recently a master graduate from SIIT with supervision of <a href="https://www.siit.tu.ac.th/page_bx.php?cid=112&cno=122&show=">Assist. Prof. Shu-Han Hsu</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6uMrUsQAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Sanparith Marukatat</a>. Our paper, _"Physics-informed graph neural networks accelerating microneedle simulations towards novelty of micro-nano scale materials discovery,"_ is almost published.

> I'm looking for a PhD position (where we have a happy lab and I belong). 

> I'm also looking for the meaning of life 😄
