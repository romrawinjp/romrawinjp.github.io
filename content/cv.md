## About me

<img align="left" src="/images/profile.jpg" alt= "Jinpu" width="145" height="145" style="margin: 15px">

My name is Romrawin Chumpu. You can call me "Jin" in short. My goal is to become a good researcher in the fields of computer simulation/graphics and machine learning. Based on my experience, my current topics of interest include (but not limited to)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⚙️ **Physical simulation** - fluid and materials simulation (macro or micro-nano scale) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧊 **Computer graphics** - UV texture/mapping, mesh processing, and 3D visualization <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🤖 **Machine learning** - geometric deep learning, LLM, physics-informed neural networks, diffusion, generative adversarial networks, and graph neural networks <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🖼️ **Computer vision and image processing** - 2D and 3D face study, object recognition, image and 3D dense captioning. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🗣️ **Natural language processing** - LLM, image and 3D dense captioning <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⚗️ **Computational chemistry/biology** - epidemiology model, organic chemistry, materials property prediction, and _materials discovery_

<!-- > I'm most excited about materials discovery. If anyone want to discuss about this, please don't hesitate to email me! -->

Also, I am recently a master graduate from SIIT with supervision of <a href="https://www.siit.tu.ac.th/page_bx.php?cid=112&cno=122&show=">Assist. Prof. Shu-Han Hsu</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6uMrUsQAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Sanparith Marukatat</a>. Our paper, _**"Physics-informed graph neural networks accelerating microneedle simulations towards novelty of micro-nano scale materials discovery,"**_ is published. If you're interested, you can read the full paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623010783">here</a>, which requires an institutional subscription. I believe that our work can leverage the boundary of physics-based simulation and machine learning guided to an innovative way of optimizing new materials of interest. 

<!-- > I'm looking for a PhD position (where we have a happy lab and I belong).  -->

<!-- > While studying is not the only thing, I'm also finding for the meaning of life, learning about what I can do best and what can I give it back to the society.  -->
