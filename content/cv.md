## About me

<img align="left" src="/images/profile.png" alt= "Jinpu" width="150" height="170" style="margin: 15px">

My name is Romrawin Chumpu. You can call me "Jinpu" or "Jin" in short. I am currently working as a *research assistant* at Image Processing and Understanding Reserch Team at [National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)](https://www.nectec.or.th/) as a part of [National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)](https://www.nstda.or.th/). My current work is under the project Image Captioning. I am researching a technique the most neural way of making a caption in Thai. Multimodal machine learning is the most challenging work for me, but I really love my work.
