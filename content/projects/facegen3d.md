This is 3D face generation project, I was having so much fun building my face in one click! I programmed all in python. Back in 2021 (two years prior learning Blender), I did the texture translation pipeline from OpenCV and PyTorch3D + math equations visualized from my ideas (which I thought it should be working). 

Steps here are consisted of (1) getting face landmarks, (2) preprocess face image, (3) extracting UV texture, (4) and transfer texture to 3D landmarks. The code is workable in Google Colab.
