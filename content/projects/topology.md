Something I made nerds out of topology forms! Nothing remarkable, just some fun for a nerd! 

# Air Dry Clayopology

What is this word ðŸ˜†?

The result after glazing

**Process Duration** - Sculpting (2 mins) -> Waiting for it to dry (0.5 day) -> Fixing the cracks (3 days) -> Sanding (2 days) -> Coloring (30 mins) -> Glazing (1 day)

Dude! what were you doing with fixing the cracks and sanding!? -- Or life is just like that, all we do is fixing the cracks! But sanding was personally mesmerized for me, no more philosophy murmuring ðŸ˜†.

M: Jin! Can you make something useful out of the clay? <br>
J: Here it is. How is it not useful? <br>
M: How is it useful? <br>
J: Look at it! It has at least infinite way! ðŸ˜„ <br>
J: Okie... It can hold your pen at least.
