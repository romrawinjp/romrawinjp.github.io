Here is my final image. This project became meaningful to me because...

![Final image](/images/artworks/final.png)

I knew I always put on hidden messages in my art. Unlike a young me, I don't want to or any reason I restricted myself to find it out. This is probably the first time I will touch on that. It might be worth learning on this shade of my experience. 

# Here are what I was thinking

- I intentionally removed Flynn from the original Tangled's scene because I think we need to express who we are. As a human, we are on this path of life alone. Life is too short to stay at something that isn't you. We must be potent by our own values, not by outside influences. I want to tell people who see my art to be proud, sincere, and authentic to themselves. That was also what I want to tell every woman (inspired by my strong mom).

- This character is not me! When I modeled, I think she/they is/are the person I would want to be right now/ in the near future. Her personality is confident at a humble level, driven by powerful passions, and has always felt a lot of positivity in this cruel world. 

- Initially, I didn't imagine that she will be in a happy scene. I wanted to model her to feel hopeful. At the end, it is actually what I want. If you see the pic immidately, you will feel she is happy. But for a longer time, you will see her hope and relief from her eyes (which is match the scene perfectly). 

- Boat over the sea stands for <b>loneliness</b>. Lanterns surrounded the boat means <b>hope</b> for me.
