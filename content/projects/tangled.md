Here is my final image. This project became meaningful to me because...

![Final image](/images/artworks/final.png)

I knew I always put on hidden messages in my art. Unlike a young me, I don't want to or any reason I restricted myself to find it out. This is probably the first time I will touch on that. It might be worth learning on this shade of my experience. 

# Here are what I was thinking

- I intentionally removed Flynn from the original Tangled's scene because I think we need to express who we are. As a human, we are on this path of life alone. Life is short; it is not worth staying at what is not you. We must potent by our own values without outside stimuli. I want to tell people who see my art; be proud, be true, be genuine to your ownself. That was also what I want to tell every woman (inspired from my strong mom).

- This character is not me! When I modeled, I think she/they is/are the person I would want to be right now/ in the near future. Personality that she can express is confident at a humble threshold, inspired by powerful passions, and always felt loads of positivity in this cruel world. 

- Initially, I didn't imagine that she will be in a happy scene. I've wanted to model her to feel hopeful. At the end, it is actually what I want. If you see the pic immidately, you will feel she is happy. But for a longer time, you will see her hope and relief from her eyes (which is match the scene perfectly). 

- Boat over the sea stands for <b>aloneliness</b>. Lanterns surrounded the boat means <b>hope</b> for me.
