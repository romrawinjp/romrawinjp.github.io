As a human in this cruel world, one of the most precious things that everyone deserves is gratification. I am thankful for everyone who is striving for a better world for their loved ones ðŸ˜Š

> Thank you for seeing me, while I don't see myself. -- Romrawin's Master Thesis, 2022

> It's not your fault if you have always been deciding to put your family first, your dreams after. It is just a destiny. I'm thankful for that. -- Me to me, 2024

> I am grateful for everyone who sees my ability and believes in me, even on those days when I have nothing to offer. Genuinely thank you for transforming me into a better person, I could not imagine how I could be before that. -- Me to ones who have always been here with me, 2024

> Thank you for always being here with me. -- Me to my life-long high school friends who, whenever I need them, are always the same kids I know.
