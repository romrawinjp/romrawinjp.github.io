# Disney Wish Star Crochet Pattern

I fell in love with this character in one of Disney's 100th anniversary movies!

This star is also beginner friendly to crochet. I want everyone to have their own wish-star. Let's do it!

Warning - this is a prototype 1, the look now might be little spooky :D.

I will experiment the pattern more and update on that cuteness later on.
