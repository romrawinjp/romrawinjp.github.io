# Disney Wish Star Crochet Pattern

![wish star](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qf44DJ8-a5k/maxresdefault.jpg)

I fell in love with this character in one of Disney's 100th anniversary movies!

This star is also beginner friendly to crochet. I want everyone to have their own wish-star. Let's do it!

Warning - this is a prototype 1, the look now might be little spooky :D.

> I will experiment the pattern more and update on that cuteness later on. 

I have two sizes for now. I think the small one is very easy!

# Crochet Parts

We have 4 parts here: body, star's cones, heart face, and star's face.

## Small Disney's Star Pattern

I think any size of yearn and crochet hook should be doable. 

### 1. Body

**R1** - 6 Magic ring (6) <br>
**R2** - (inc) x 6 (12) <br>
**R3** - (sc, inc) x 6 (18) <br>
**R4** - sc, inc (sc x 2, inc) x 5, sc (24) <br>
**R5-R9** - sc x 24 (24) <br>
**R10** - sc, dec (sc x 2, dec) x 5, sc (18) <br>
**R11** - (sc, dec) x 6 (18) <br>
**R12** - (dec) x 6 (6) <br>
**R13** - yarn over all 6 together and finish the body!


### 2. Star's Cones

**R1** - 4 Magic ring (4) <br>
**R2** - (inc) x 4 (8) <br>
Finish it and leave the yarn open

Do this cone 5 times

### 3. Heart Face

Use the plain flannel texture type of cloth and cut it in heart shape ðŸ’“. 

### 4. Star's Face

This is very flexible. Choose any expression you like! For example, here...

I also use plain flannel cloth but in darker color. Cut to the shapes of eyes and mounth of the star's expression you chose. 


Ensemble! Sew all parts together and glue the face. You get your wish star now ðŸ˜Š
