My dad and I got a new project from my friend. We are going the paint water textures on the floor for our local night safari's exhibition. I got to learn more about how to paint them and ocean variaion from shallow to deep ocean. Mostly I don't know how to do it! So, this is probably worth taking a note what I learn here ðŸ˜„.
