Who can make hobby goes crazy! That might be me. 

I invented the patterns often. The thing happens at one moment when I got annoyed that I don't know know much yarn I need to use for a project. So, this will be my small (research) project, reviewing and reading all yarn simulation stuff. And actually crochet is like programming, I think we can do so many thing with its algorithm.

# (Crochet) Yarn Simulation

**Goal:** How much yarn I need to use?
