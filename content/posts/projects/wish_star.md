# Disney Wish Star Crochet Pattern

![wish star](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qf44DJ8-a5k/maxresdefault.jpg)

I fell in love with this character so much, star, in one of Disney's 100th anniversary movies!

For crochet pattern, this star is also beginner friendly to crochet. I want everyone to have their own wishing star. Let's do it!

Warning - this is a prototype 1, the look now might be little spooky :D.

> I'll continue to play with the pattern, I'm sure that cuteness will glow with the star. 

I have invented two sizes for now. I think the small one is very easy to make!

# Crochet Parts

We are going to make 4 parts of the star here: body, star's cones, heart face, and star's face.

## Small Disney's Star Pattern

I think any size of yarn and crochet hook should be doable. But here I used 4 ply yarn and 1.75 mm hook.

### 1. Body

**R1** - 6 Magic ring (6) <br>
**R2** - (inc) x 6 (12) <br>
**R3** - (sc, inc) x 6 (18) <br>
**R4** - sc, inc (sc x 2, inc) x 5, sc (24) <br>
**R5-R9** - sc x 24 (24) <br>
**R10** - sc, dec (sc x 2, dec) x 5, sc (18) <br>
**R11** - (sc, dec) x 6 (12) (I stuff at this row) <br> 
**R12** - (dec) x 6 (6) <br>
**R13** - yarn over all 6 together and finish the body!


### 2. Star's Cones

**R1** - 4 Magic ring (4) <br>
**R2** - (inc) x 4 (8) <br>
Finish it and leave the yarn open

Do this cone 5 times

### 3. Heart Face

Use the plain flannel texture type of cloth and cut it in heart shape ðŸ’“. 

### 4. Star's Face

This is very flexible. Choose any expression you like! For example, here...

I also use plain flannel cloth but in darker color. Cut to the shapes of eyes and mouth of the star's expression you chose. 

Ensemble! Sew all parts together and glue the face. You get your wishing star now ðŸ˜Š
